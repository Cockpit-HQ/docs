# Configuration

By default, Cockpit doesn't need any further configuration to run. However, the default configuration settings are insecure that allow file upload of any type and use a default custom security key. Additionally, you might want to use MongoDB instead of SQLite as your favorite data storage.

Cockpit provides an easy way to tweak some settings. Below is an example configuration file.

It is important to note that developers and users of Cockpit CMS are responsible for hardening their Cockpit CMS server.
