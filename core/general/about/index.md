## The Headless CMS That Adapts to You

Cockpit is a self-hosted, developer-friendly headless CMS that gives you complete control over your content infrastructure. Born from real-world agency needs in 2011, Cockpit has evolved into a powerful platform trusted by developers and organizations worldwide who value flexibility, ownership, and simplicity.

## Why Developers Love Cockpit

### **Freedom Without Boundaries**
Unlike traditional CMSs that force you into rigid structures, Cockpit adapts to your workflow. Create the exact content models your project needs - whether that's a simple blog, complex e-commerce catalog, or IoT dashboard.

### **Your Stack, Your Rules**
As a true headless CMS, Cockpit works seamlessly with any technology:
- **Frontend**: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, or vanilla JS
- **Mobile**: React Native, Flutter, Swift, Kotlin
- **Static Sites**: Next.js, Nuxt, Gatsby, Hugo
- **Backend**: Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, Go

### **Lightning Fast APIs**
Get your content through modern REST or GraphQL APIs with:
- MongoDB queries for powerful filtering
- Field selection to minimize payload
- Automatic image optimization
- Built-in caching for blazing performance

## What Makes Cockpit Different

### **1. True Data Ownership**
Your content lives on **your** servers, not someone else's cloud. This means:
- Complete control over data privacy and security
- No vendor lock-in or surprise price increases
- Compliance with data residency requirements
- Ability to run in air-gapped environments

### **2. Developer Experience First**
We built Cockpit for developers who appreciate:
- Clean, well-documented APIs
- Minimal dependencies (just PHP and a database)
- Extensible architecture with hooks and events
- No build steps or complex toolchains

### **3. Flexible Content Modeling**
Create content structures that match your mental model:
- **Collections**: For repeatable content (posts, products, events)
- **Singletons**: For unique content (settings, about pages)
- **Trees**: For hierarchical content (navigation, categories)
- **20+ Field Types**: From simple text to complex relationships

### **4. Enterprise-Ready Features**
While simple to start with, Cockpit scales with your needs:
- Multi-language content with fallback support
- User roles and granular permissions
- API authentication with tokens
- Webhooks for real-time integrations
- Multi-tenant spaces for agencies

## Real-World Use Cases

### **Content-Driven Websites**
Power your marketing sites, blogs, and portfolios with dynamic content that editors love to manage.

### **Mobile Applications**
Deliver content to iOS and Android apps through consistent APIs, with automatic image resizing for different screen sizes.

### **Digital Signage & IoT**
Manage content for kiosks, displays, and smart devices from a central hub.

### **Multi-Brand Platforms**
Run multiple sites from a single Cockpit instance using Spaces-perfect for agencies and enterprises.

### **Internal Tools**
Build custom dashboards, knowledge bases, and data management tools on top of Cockpit's flexible foundation.

## Built on Solid Foundations

### **Technology Stack**
- **PHP 8.3+**: Modern, performant, and widely supported
- **SQLite or MongoDB**: Choose the database that fits your scale
- **Vue.js 3**: Reactive, modern admin interface
- **No Framework Lock-in**: Lightweight custom architecture

### **Open Source Heritage**
Cockpit has been open source since day one:
- MIT licensed for maximum freedom
- Active community of contributors
- Transparent development on GitHub
- No hidden features behind paywalls in Core

## Philosophy

### **Simplicity Over Complexity**
We believe tools should solve problems, not create them. Cockpit gives you powerful features without overwhelming complexity.

### **Developer Empowerment**
You know your project best. Cockpit provides the building blocks-you create the solution.
