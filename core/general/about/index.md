# Introduction

[[toc]]

Cockpit is a self-hosted, flexible and user-friendly headless content platform for creating custom digital experiences.

Initially developed by [Agentejo](https://agentejo.com) back in 2011 as a need for highly customized digital projects and evolving since then.

## Why Cockpit?

Good question - let it be answered by a few key facts:

* Cockpit Core is 100% open source - you can contribute, copy code or modify Cockpit to suit your own needs at any time.
* Cockpit is built as a stand-alone solution without major dependencies.
* Highly customizable and extensible code base
* Cockpit is self-hosted, which means that anything you need is a webserver running PHP. See [Installation](/quickstart/installation).


## Use Cockpit for free

Cockpit Core is free of charge for everyone. Just install and start using it.

## Own your data

In contrast to headless solutions provided as SaaS (Software as a service) Cockpit is self-hosted. With a self-hosted application running on your webserver of choice you have full control over the data and content stored in Cockpit.

This allows you to run Cockpit i.e.

* on a hosting provider you trust
* on a web server of your own
* in an intranet

### Extend and modify Cockpit

As Cockpit Core is a 100% open-source application you can modify and extend it if you need or wish to.
